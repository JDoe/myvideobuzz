{"name":"Myvideobuzz","tagline":"MyVideoBuzz","body":"Roku YouTube\r\n=============\r\n\r\n\r\nA YouTube app for the Roku DVP that supports automatic video quality switching, \r\nuser favorites, searches and more based on the [Picasa Web Albums Roku app](http://bitbucket.org/chrishoffman/roku-picasa/) \r\nby [Chris Hoffman](http://bitbucket.org/chrishoffman).\r\n\r\nThe channel performs OAuth authentication to access your YouTube account via an \r\naddress I've set up on my domain running Chris Hoffman's excellent [Google Apps Engine\r\nRokuLink project](https://bitbucket.org/chrishoffman/appengine-rokulink), great for\r\nserving your own OAuth requests if my server goes down.\r\n\r\n###[https://owner.roku.com/add/3K5SKG](https://owner.roku.com/add/3K5SKG)\r\n\r\nInstallation\r\n============\r\n\r\nEnable development mode on your Roku Streaming Player with the following remote \r\ncontrol sequence:\r\n\r\n    Home 3x, Up 2x, Right, Left, Right, Left, Right\r\n\r\nWhen devleopment mode is enabled on your Roku, you can install dev packages\r\nfrom the Application Installer which runs on your device at your device's IP\r\naddress. Open up a standard web browser and visit the following URL:\r\n\r\n    http://<rokuPlayer-ip-address> (for example, http://192.168.1.6)\r\n\r\n[Download the source as a zip](https://bitbucket.org/jesstech/roku-youtube/get/master.zip) and upload it to your Roku device.\r\n\r\nDue to limitations in the sandboxing of development Roku channels, you can only\r\nhave one development channel installed at a time.\r\n\r\nAdvanced\r\n========\r\n\r\n### Debugging\r\n\r\nYour Roku's debug console can be accessed by telnet at port 8085:\r\n\r\n    telnet <rokuPlayer-ip-address> 8085\r\n\r\n### Building from source\r\n\r\nThe [Roku Developer SDK](http://www.roku.com/developer) includes a handy Make script \r\nfor automatically zipping and installing the channel onto your device should you make\r\nany changes.  Just add the project to your SDK's `examples/source` folder and run the\r\n`make install` command from that directory via your terminal.\r\n\r\n\r\nContributing\r\n------------\r\n\r\nWant to contribute? Great! Go ahead and download the source, play around with it, fork it \r\nif you like, whatever.  I've only added basic functionality, so if you think you can help\r\nout I'd love to have your contribution!","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
